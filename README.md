### Restaurant Reservation System Capstone Project

## Introduction

This project is for the Software Engineering Immersive Program Final Capstone at Thinkful.  The starter code was provided and is discussed in the Instructions.md file.

This project's purpose is to showcase my ability to update a webpage from a very basic format to include 8 separate user stories.  The user stories are described in detail in the Instructions.md file.  The purpose of this README is to showcase the final project, what went into its development and how to set it up so you can take a look at the code and implementation.  Once it is completed and fully deployed, a link to the deployment will also be included along with images.

So sit back and enjoy this process as I work through the user stories.
